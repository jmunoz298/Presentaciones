  abstract = {We contrast two theoretical approaches to social influence, one stressing interpersonal dependence, conceptualized as normative and informational influence (Deutsch \& Gerard, 1955), and the other stressing group membership, conceptualized as self-categorization and referent informational influence (Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher \& Wetherell, 1987). We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as belonging to one's own category. This study tested these two approaches using three influence paradigms. First we demonstrate that, in Sherif's (1936) autokinetic effect paradigm, the impact of confederates on the formation of a norm decreases as their membership of a different category is made more salient to subjects. Second, in the Asch (1956) conformity paradigm, surveillance effectively exerts normative pressure if done by an in-group but not by an out-group. In-group influence decreases and out-group influence increases when subjects respond privately. Self-report data indicate that in-group confederates create more subjective uncertainty than out-group confederates and public responding seems to increase cohesiveness with in-group - but decrease it with out-group - sources of influence. In our third experiment we use the group polarization paradigm (e.g. Burnstein \& Vinokur, 1973) to demonstrate that, when categorical differences between two subgroups within a discussion group are made salient, convergence of opinion between the subgroups is inhibited. Taken together the experiments show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence.},

EL art{\'i}culo comienza con la observaci{\'o}n de que en la literatura sobre AC tales pr{\'a}cticas y los objetos anal{\'i}ticos que crean (la grabaci{\'o}n y la transcripci{\'o}n) son tratados de manera diferente. Dicho de manera simple, la grabac{\'i}on es un objeto "realista", mientras que la transcripci{\'o}n es "constructivista". La importancia de esta diferencia es explorada a trav{\'e}s del an{\'a}lisis de la din{\'a}mica de la pr{\'a}ctica del AC. Argumentamos que la "transcripci{\'o}n constructivista", se basa en la premisa de una comprensi{\'o}n del AC como estrategia predominantemente interesada en maximizar su utilidad anal{\'i}tica: un inter{\'e}s por una etapa temporal distinta del trabajo del AC, la de la aprehensi{\'o}n "inocente" de objetos a trav{\'e}s de su "primer momento". En contraste, la "transcripci{\'o}n realista" se basa en un aspecto diferente del trabajo del AC: la petici{\'o}n de una mayor "utilidad de evidencia", alcanzada por la revisi{\'o}n "nost{\'a}lgica" de objetos previamente producidos con prop{\'o}sito de contrastarlos entre s{\'i}; trabajo realizado "a trav{\'e}s del siguiente momento". Adicionalmente argumentamos que tanto la ontolog{\'i}a y la epistemolog{\'i}a de los objetos del AC se cambian en cualquier encuentro que ocurra. Concluimos con una advertencia especulativa sobre la actualmente proyectada transcripci{\'o}n libre y en el futuro digitalizada del AC.},

There is a need for greater disclosure in qualitative analysis, and for more sophisticated tools to facilitate such analyses. In this article details a technique for conducting thematic analysis of qualitative material, presenting a step-by-step guide of the analytic process, with the aid of an empirical example. The analytic method presented employs established, well-known techniques; the article proposes that thematic analyses can be usefully aided by and presented as thematic networks. Thematic networks are web-like illustrations that summarize the main themes constituting a piece of text. The thematic networks technique is a robust and highly sensitive toot for the systematization and presentation of qualitative analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

 authority capable of leading people in a television studio to inflict cruel acts on others, even though they
 condemn those acts.
Objective. \textendash{} The experiment reported here allows us to answer this question in the affirmative. Therefore,
 we transposed Milgram's famous experimental obedience paradigm to the context of a ``real'' TV game
 show, in the studio of a large television production company, with a live audience and no prizes.
Method. \textendash{} We set up several experimental conditions designed to tell us if, in such contexts, obedience
 was the dominant response, as it is in the often-replicated classic situation. We also wished to know if
 the introduction of variations would reduce obedience.
Results. \textendash{} The results show that obedience to the host is the dominant response, as it is in Milgram's classic
 situation. However, variations that are assumed to reduce this obedience do not in fact demonstrate the
 expected effects. An additional experimental condition appears to demonstrate that a determining factor
 of obedience is the physical proximity of the host incarnating the televisual power.
Conclusion. \textendash{} We offer a conclusion addressing the societal aspects of obedience.},

Memoing is often discussed in the literature as a technique employed in grounded theory research, yet there is limited exploration of the value of memo writing in qualitative methodologies generally. Memoing serves to assist the researcher in making conceptual leaps from raw data to those abstractions that explain research phenomena in the context in which it is examined. Memos can be effectively employed by both the novice and experienced researcher as a procedural and analytical strategy throughout the research process. Data exploration is enhanced, continuity of conception and contemplation is enabled and communication is facilitated through the use of memoing. While guidelines exist to aid in the production and use of memos, memoing remains a flexible strategy wherein the process of construction and nature of content is determined by the preferences and abilities of the researcher and the aims and focus of the specific research study.},

  abstract = {Following the methodological debate within the construction management research community in the 1990s, research studies adopting inductive methodologies have increased. Many such projects have adopted computer-aided qualitative data analysis in order both to facilitate the research process and to ensure methodological rigour and transparency. However, there remains a paucity of critical discourse within the construction management research literature about the impact of such approaches on the depth and rigour of the resulting analyses. This paper posits that so-called computer-aided approaches have the potential to affect detrimentally the outcomes of construction management research if researchers see such tools as a panacea for ensuring the rigour and transparency of their work. Paradoxically, computer-aided approaches often restrict rather than aid the analytical process. The paper draws upon the authors' experiences of using a leading package from which a number of considerations for the use of computers in qualitative data analysis are discussed. It is concluded that the research community would benefit from an open debate on whether computer packages really do provide a panacea to the analysis of qualitative data in applied construction management research projects or whether their use merely provides a label with which to convince sceptical positivists of the rigour of inductive research techniques.Suite au d{\'e}bat m{\'e}thodologique intervenu au sein de la communaut{\'e} de la recherche dans les ann{\'e}es 1990 dans le domaine de la gestion de construction, les {\'e}tudes de recherche adoptant des m{\'e}thodologies inductives se sont accrues. De nombreux projets de ce type ont adopt{\'e} une analyse qualitative des donn{\'e}es assist{\'e}e par ordinateur {\`a} la fois afin de faciliter le processus de recherche et d'assurer une transparence et une rigueur m{\'e}thodologiques. N{\'e}anmoins, une indigence du discours critique demeure, s'agissant de la litt{\'e}rature relative aux recherches dans le domaine de la gestion de construction concernant l'impact de telles approches sur la rigueur et le caract{\`e}re approfondi des analyses qui en r{\'e}sultent. Cet article postule que les approches dites assist{\'e}es par ordinateur ont la capacit{\'e} d'affecter de fa{\c c}on pr{\'e}judiciable les r{\'e}sultats des recherches dans le domaine de la gestion de construction si les chercheurs consid{\`e}rent ces outils comme une panac{\'e}e pour assurer la rigueur et la transparence de leurs travaux. Paradoxalement, les approches assist{\'e}es par ordinateur restreignent souvent le processus analytique plus qu'elles n'y contribuent. L'article fait appel {\`a} l'exp{\'e}rience des auteurs concernant l'utilisation de l'un des principaux progiciels, {\`a} partir de laquelle un certain nombre de consid{\'e}rations relatives {\`a} l'utilisation des ordinateurs dans l'analyse qualitative des donn{\'e}es sont discut{\'e}es. La conclusion est que la communaut{\'e} de la recherche tirerait avantage d'un d{\'e}bat ouvert sur le fait de savoir si les progiciels informatiques fournissent vraiment une panac{\'e}e pour l'analyse des donn{\'e}es qualitatives des projets de recherche appliqu{\'e}e dans le domaine de la gestion de construction, ou si leur utilisation ne fournit qu'une {\'e}tiquette avec laquelle les positivistes sceptiques peuvent {\^e}tre convaincus de la rigueur des techniques de recherche inductives.},

Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users/' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between /`close friends/' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

Seventy adults participated in a replication of Milgram's Experiment 5 up to the point at which they first heard the learner's verbal protest (150 volts). Because 79\% of Milgram's participants who went past this point continued to the end of the shock generator's range, reasonable estimates could be made about what the present participants would have done if allowed to continue. Obedience rates in the 2006 replication were only slightly lower than those Milgram found 45 years earlier. Contrary to expectation, participants who saw a confederate refuse the experimenter's instructions obeyed as often as those who saw no model.
Men and women did not differ in their rates of obedience, but there was some evidence that individual differences in empathic concern and desire for control affected participants' responses.},

A participant observation study found evidence of a radicalized self concept among a number of crowd members, and indicates a link between radicalization, an asymmetry of categorical representations between protesters and the police, and the subsequent interaction premised on these divergent representations. The analysis supports an elaborated social identity model of crowd behaviour (Reicher, 1996, 1997a, 1997b; Stott \& Reicher, 1998). It is argued that, in order to account for both social determination and social change in collective behaviour, it is necessary to analyse crowd events as developing interactions between groups. Where crowd members hold a different understanding of their social position to that held by an out-group (e.g. the police) and where the out-group has the power to treat crowd members in terms of its understandings, then those members who act on the basis of one understanding of their social relations find themselves in an unexpected and novel set of social relations. This then provides the basis for a series of changes, including the self-understanding of crowd members.},

The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces `panic' behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).},

  abstract = {In this article, we examine the interpretations by social psychologists of Asch's widely cited study of independence and conformity. Though it has become known as the `Asch Conformity Study', Asch equally, if not more, intended and interpreted it as demonstrating the powers of independence.The evidence for this analysis consists of 99 accounts in social psychology textbooks published between 1953, following the appearance of his study, and 1984. We asked whether these accounts were accurate, or whether, as we suspected, they minimized the role of independence and exaggerated that of conformity. We found that authors have often distorted Asch's findings, and that this trend has increased substantially with time: they have increasingly accentuated the role of conformity and underestimated that of independence.We suggest several reasons for this distortion. For one, there has been insufficient care in reading the findings and drawing conclusions. Second, authors have generally limited themselves to reports of quantitative results. Although these were strong and beyond question, authors have usually neglected the intimately connected qualitative findings, which would have discouraged the misinterpretations. Third, the study of Asch was an integral part of his perspective on social psychology, which authors again ignored, thus encouraging a limited and out-of-context view of his study. We conclude with a thematic presentation of Asch's general theoretical framework, showing how it bears on independence and conformity.},

  abstract = {There are many different methods in qualitative research and also many ways to approach the analysis of qualitative data. Even though nowadays, the use of Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) is widespread, usually in the books and papers that describe an approach, it is not explained how to implement the analysis using software; it is assumed that this is self-explanatory. This often leads to frustration when using an analysis package ((Weber 2014), up to the point where the analysis is given up and researchers return to paper and pencil. To work with CAQDAS, one must first know which requirements the chosen analysis approach has. Then one needs to be familiar with the features that the software offers. And thirdly, one needs to know how the individual methodological steps can be implemented. This paper shows how the phases of a selected Thematic Content Analysis (TCA) can be realized in a software-aided analysis. The sample project that is used here for illustration purposes was provided by Jacks Soratto and Denise Pires. It is about job satisfaction and the dissatisfaction of professionals working in the Family Health System in Brazil. The implementation is described by the CAQDAS expert Susanne Friese. Before presenting the implementation, the different approaches of TCA are presented, and the individual analysis phases are explained. This paper is the second in a series that describes how a qualitative data analysis approach can be implemented using computerized qualitative data analysis software. The first one was on how to conduct a Grounded Theory analysis with ATLAS.ti (Friese, 2016).},

Norton \& Company, New York, London] theory of communication.},

Many of the most famous figures in psychology - Asch, Milgram and Zimbardo and others - have emphasized the pressures to conform and obey which are present in groups, and focused on the positive value that groups place on loyalty and uniformity. From this perspective, dissent, deviance, difference and defiance have been regarded as detrimental forces within groups: reflections of a lack of group loyalty, a sign of disengagement or delinquent behaviour. Contrary to traditional views, this book presents an approach which considers rebellion to be a normal, functional and healthy aspect of group life. Rebels in Groups presents the latest thinking on these issues by examining a broad range of groups - such as political groups, task groups, and teams in organisations - and by considering diverse fields of psychology, including social, organizational, and developmental psychology. In the process, it shows how new approaches to the study of dissent, deviance, difference and defiance have refined our theorizing in this area and shed a more nuanced light upon the role of rebels in groups"--},

In recent years new paradigms have been developed to circumvent these challenges but none involve using Milgram's own procedures and asking na{\"i}ve participants to deliver the maximum level of shock. This was achieved in the present research by using Immersive Digital Realism (IDR) to revisit the OtA paradigm. IDR is a dramatic method that involves a director collaborating with professional actors to develop characters, the strategic withholding of contextual information, and immersion in a real-world environment. 14 actors took part in an IDR study in which they were assigned to conditions that restaged Milgrams's New Baseline (`Coronary') condition and four other variants. Post-experimental interviews also assessed participants' identification with Experimenter and Learner. Participants' behaviour closely resembled that observed in Milgram's original research. In particular, this was evidenced by (a) all being willing to administer shocks greater than 150 volts, (b) near-universal refusal to continue after being told by the Experimenter that ``you have no other choice, you must continue'' (Milgram's fourth prod and the one most resembling an order), and (c) a strong correlation between the maximum level of shock that participants administered and the mean maximum shock delivered in the corresponding variant in Milgram's own research. Consistent with an engaged follower account, relative identification with the Experimenter (vs. the Learner) was also a good predictor of the maximum shock that participants administered.},

  abstract = {We are poised between an old world that no longer works and a new one struggling to be born. Surrounded by centralized hierarchies on the one hand and predatory markets on the other, people around the world are searching for alternatives. The Wealth of the Commons explains how millions of commoners have organized to defend their forests and fisheries, reinvent local food systems, organize productive online communities, reclaim public spaces, improve environmental stewardship and re-imagine the very meaning of "progress" and governance. In short, how they've built their commons.
	In 73 timely essays by a remarkable international roster of activists, academics and project leaders, this book chronicles ongoing struggles against the private com\-moditization of shared resources - often known as market enclosures - while docu\-menting the immense generative power of the commons. The Wealth of the Commons is about history, political change, public policy and cultural transformation on a global scale - but most of all, it's about individual commoners taking charge of their lives and their endangered resources.

"This fine collection makes clear that the idea of the Commons is fully international, and increasingly fully worked-out. If you find yourself wondering what Occupy wants, or if some other world is possible, this pragmatic, down-to-earth, and unsentimental book will provide many of the answers." - Bill McKibben, author of Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and The Durable Future},

The present exposition tries to condense the aspects dealt with in the textbook Collective Behavior and Social Movements. A Social-Psychological Approach (Javaloy, Rodriguez and Espelt, 2001) that can be more suggestive for the social psychologist. The book attempts to offer a global vision of collective behavior and social movements, task that had been undertaken previously within the framework of sociology but widely neglected by academic social psychology, specially in the Spanish language. The work keeps correspondence with the three parts in which the book is structured, our analysis focusing on the first part (scientific foundation of the field) and on the third one, referring to the social movements. Of the second part, only some social-psychological research on groups is mentioned that can be considered the most important contribution of experimental social psychology to the study of collective behavior and social movements. The social relevance of the field is also emphasized, trying to offer a reflection of the globalizing society in some of its more problematic aspects, such as ecological crisis, sexism, terrorism and social inequalities.},

On a majority of trials confederates rendered decisions that were contrary to judgments typically elicited by the dilemmas. The results showed a pronounced effect of conformity: Compared to the control condition, permissible actions were deemed less permissible when confederates found them objectionable, and impermissible actions were judged more permissible if confederates judged them so.},

  abstract = {While mass panic (and/or violence) and self-preservation are often assumed to be the natural response to physical danger and perceived entrapment, the literature indicates that expressions of mutual aid are common and often predominate, and collective flight may be so delayed that survival is threatened. In fact, the typical response to a variety of threats and disasters is not to flee but to seek the proximity of familiar persons and places; moreover, separation from attachment figures is a greater stressor than physical danger. Such observations can be explained by an alternative ``social attachment'' model that recognizes the fundamentally gregarious nature of human beings and the primacy of attachments. In the relatively rare instances where flight occurs, the latter can be understood as one aspect of a more general affiliative response that involves escaping from certain situations and moving toward other situations that are perceived as familiar but which may not necessarily be objectively safe. The occurrence of flight-and-affiliation depends mainly on the social context and especially the whereabouts of familiar persons (i.e., attachment figures); their physical presence has a calming effect and reduces the probability of flight-and-affiliation, while their absence has the opposite effect. Combining the factors of perceived physical danger and the location of attachment figures results in a four-fold typology that encompasses a wide spectrum of collective responses to threat and disaster. Implications of the model for predicting community responses to terrorist attacks and/or use of weapons of mass destruction are briefly discussed.},

First the development of content analysis is delineated and the basic principles are explained (units of analysis, step models, working with categories, validity and reliability). Then the central procedures of qualitative content analysis, inductive development of categories and deductive application of categories, are worked out. The possibilities of computer programs in supporting those qualitative steps of analysis are shown and the possibilities and limits of the approach are discussed.},

Rumor, mass hysteria, fads and fashion, UFOs, sports, migrations, disasters, riots, protest, and social movements are among the topics presented in a unique side-by-side presentation of the two disciplines. In an engaging, accessible style, Miller offers detailed discussion of classic sociological studies interspersed with intriguing modern-day examples that students will enjoy reading.

Ciento cuatro estudiantes japoneses (40 hombres y 64 mujeres) desarrollaron tareas equivalentes a las de Asch en grupos de cuatro personas del mismo sexo.

Los mismos nueve est{\'i}mulos que Asch utiliz{\'o}, fueron reproducidos cuidadosamente en transparencias de Power Point y proyectadas en una pantalla semi-transparente. Respecto de la tarea principal, la parte superior de las l{\'i}neas estandarizadas aparec{\'i}an en color verde o magenta.

  abstract = {When British Paratroopers shot dead 13 people at a civil rights march in Derry on January 30, 1972 it dealt a hammer blow to British government claims of neutrality and moral authority in dealing with the escalating violence in Northern Ireland. Existing historical accounts of Bloody Sunday treat the killings as the outcome of a more-or-less unified military anxiety at increasing disorder in Derry, combined with unexpected events on the day, presenting the killings as the outcome of essentially responsive actions by the British military. In so doing they lend support to the `cock-up' theory that represents the killings as the outcome of a series of errors of interpretation and communication. This article provides an alternative interpretation of the political and military decision-making process, challenging key elements in the analysis in the existing literature. By contrast with existing accounts, it argues that the Bloody Sunday operation was a calculated plan devised at a very high level to stage a massive and unprecedented confrontation that would disrupt and shatter an established policy of security force restraint in the city of Derry. It argues further that the operation that day emerged from an intense internal struggle to shape security policy that reflected deep divisions within the security forces, analysing the statements and evidence of key participants much more critically than existing accounts do. It argues that high-level decision-making is central to the explanation of the outcome that day and that the operation raises serious questions about the relationship between political decision-making and the operational decision-making of the army in Northern Ireland.},

Even if obedience to authority is an important aspect of social life and it plays a key role in maintaining social order, the concept of obedience has been studied in social psychology mainly in terms of its destructive aspects. Besides, most of the studies have overlooked the role of disobedience in the authority relationship. Disobedience may be conceived of as a protest that undermines the legitimacy of the authority or it can represent an instrument for controlling the legitimacy of the authority's demands, becoming a factor protecting against authoritarianism. In this article, a new perspective on the study of the relationship between the individual and the authority is put forward, considering obedience and disobedience as parallel concepts, each having constructive and destructive aspects.

The analysis derives from a detailed account of a violent confrontation between students and police during a demonstration held in November 1988\textemdash{}the so-called `Battle of Westminster'. It focuses on how students came to be involved in the conflict, how the conflict spread and upon the psychological consequences of involvement. This analysis is used to develop general hypotheses concerning the initiation and development of collective conflict. It is concluded that, while the social identity model is of use in understanding these phenomena, it is necessary to recognize how social categories are constructed and reconstructed in the dynamics of intergroup interaction.},

Instead a model of crowd behaviour based on the social identity model is advanced to account for the observations. It is concluded that crowd behaviour is more sophisticated and creative than hitherto allowed and that the neglect of this field should be remedied.},

  abstract = {Traditional crowd theory decontextualizes crowd incidents and explains behaviour entirely in terms of processes internal to the crowd itself. This ignores the fact that such incidents are characteristically intergroup encounters and draws attention away from the role of groups such as the police in the development of events. This paper begins to rectify this omission through an analysis of interviews with 26 Public Order trained police concerning crowds in general and the Poll Tax `riot' of 31 March 1990 in particular. The analysis shows that, despite a perception of crowd composition as heterogeneous, officers perceive crowd dynamics as involving an anti-social minority seeking to exploit the mindlessness of ordinary people in the mass. Consequently, all crowds are seen as potentially dangerous and, in situations of actual conflict, all crowd members are seen as equally dangerous. In addition, police tactics for dealing with disorder make it very difficult to distinguish between individuals or subgroups in the crowd. This convergence of ideological and practical factors leads to the police treating crowds in disorder as an homogeneous whole. It is argued that such action can often play an important role in escalating (if not initiating) collective conflict and is also a key component of social change in crowd contexts. \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This model begins to tackle the thorny theoretical problems posed by the dynamic nature of crowd action (Reicher, 1996b). The present paper describes an ethnographic study of a crowd event in which there were changes in the inter-group relationships over time. It is suggested that the laboratory evidence in support of SCT is complemented by ethnographic research of this type. By exploring situations in which definitions of context and/or categories are not purposefully manipulated, we can demonstrate the explanatory power of a dynamic and interactive approach to social categorization.},

In other words, they are being used interchangeably and it seems difficult for the researcher to choose between them. In this respect, this paper describes and discusses the boundaries between qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis and presents implications to improve the consistency between the purpose of related studies and the method of data analyses. This is a discussion paper, comprising an analytical overview and discussion of the definitions, aims, philosophical background, data gathering, and analysis of content analysis and thematic analysis, and addressing their methodological subtleties. It is concluded that in spite of many similarities between the approaches, including cutting across data and searching for patterns and themes, their main difference lies in the opportunity for quantification of data. It means that measuring the frequency of different categories and themes is possible in content analysis with caution as a proxy for significance.},
