	abstract = {Human behaviour is thought to spread through face-to-face social networks, but it is difficult to identify social influence effects in observational studies, and it is unknown whether online social networks operate in the same way-. Here we report results from a randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections. The results show that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the users who received them but also the users/' friends, and friends of friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly all the transmission occurred between /`close friends/' who were more likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world behaviour in human social networks.},

	abstract = {Evasion (equivocation) has been identified as a matter of concern in political interviews, but no systematic study has been undertaken in the context of parliamentary discourse, notably Question Time, anywhere in the world. This study applies and adapts various approaches on how politicians ‘resist’ answering questions, all of which are based on political news interviews, to the study of evasion in parliamentary discourse. A comprehensive, unified framework for the analysis of evasion is described, a decision flowchart for the framework is provided, and an illustrative example of the applied framework is given based on Australia’s Question Time. It involved the classification of responses as ‘answers’, ‘intermediate responses’, and ‘evasions’ based on specific criteria. Responses which were considered evasions were further analysed to determine the levels of evasion, whether they were covert or overt in nature and the types of ‘agenda shifts’ that occurred, if any. The corpus investigated consists of Australia’s House of Representatives’ Question Time transcripts, for the months of February and March 2003, on the specific issue of Iraq. The study provides empirical evidence that evasion does occur during parliamentary Question Time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

Even if obedience to authority is an important aspect of social life and it plays a key role in maintaining social order, the concept of obedience has been studied in social psychology mainly in terms of its destructive aspects. Besides, most of the studies have overlooked the role of disobedience in the authority relationship. Disobedience may be conceived of as a protest that undermines the legitimacy of the authority or it can represent an instrument for controlling the legitimacy of the authority’s demands, becoming a factor protecting against authoritarianism. In this article, a new perspective on the study of the relationship between the individual and the authority is put forward, considering obedience and disobedience as parallel concepts, each having constructive and destructive aspects.

	abstract = {When British Paratroopers shot dead 13 people at a civil rights march in Derry on January 30, 1972 it dealt a hammer blow to British government claims of neutrality and moral authority in dealing with the escalating violence in Northern Ireland. Existing historical accounts of Bloody Sunday treat the killings as the outcome of a more-or-less unified military anxiety at increasing disorder in Derry, combined with unexpected events on the day, presenting the killings as the outcome of essentially responsive actions by the British military. In so doing they lend support to the ‘cock-up’ theory that represents the killings as the outcome of a series of errors of interpretation and communication. This article provides an alternative interpretation of the political and military decision-making process, challenging key elements in the analysis in the existing literature. By contrast with existing accounts, it argues that the Bloody Sunday operation was a calculated plan devised at a very high level to stage a massive and unprecedented confrontation that would disrupt and shatter an established policy of security force restraint in the city of Derry. It argues further that the operation that day emerged from an intense internal struggle to shape security policy that reflected deep divisions within the security forces, analysing the statements and evidence of key participants much more critically than existing accounts do. It argues that high-level decision-making is central to the explanation of the outcome that day and that the operation raises serious questions about the relationship between political decision-making and the operational decision-making of the army in Northern Ireland.},

This article reports the structure of an adolescent romantic and sexual network in a population of over 800 adolescents residing in a mid-sized town in the mid-western United States. Precise images and measures of network characteristics are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of eighteen months between 1993 and 1995. We compare the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks governed by similar constraints on the distribution of ties, and show that the observed structures differ radically from the randomly generated networks. Specifically, we find that real sexual and romantic networks are characterized by much longer contact chains and far fewer cycles. We then identify a set of micro-mechanisms that generates networks with similar structural features to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.},

The work keeps correspondence with the three parts in which the book is structured, our analysis focusing on the first part (scientific foundation of the field) and on the third one, referring to the social movements. Of the second part, only some social-psychological research on groups is mentioned that can be considered the most important contribution of experimental social psychology to the study of collective behavior and social movements. The social relevance of the field is also emphasized, trying to offer a reflection of the globalizing society in some of its more problematic aspects, such as ecological crisis, sexism, terrorism and social inequalities.},

	abstract = {Following the methodological debate within the construction management research community in the 1990s, research studies adopting inductive methodologies have increased. Many such projects have adopted computer-aided qualitative data analysis in order both to facilitate the research process and to ensure methodological rigour and transparency. However, there remains a paucity of critical discourse within the construction management research literature about the impact of such approaches on the depth and rigour of the resulting analyses. This paper posits that so-called computer-aided approaches have the potential to affect detrimentally the outcomes of construction management research if researchers see such tools as a panacea for ensuring the rigour and transparency of their work. Paradoxically, computer-aided approaches often restrict rather than aid the analytical process. The paper draws upon the authors' experiences of using a leading package from which a number of considerations for the use of computers in qualitative data analysis are discussed. It is concluded that the research community would benefit from an open debate on whether computer packages really do provide a panacea to the analysis of qualitative data in applied construction management research projects or whether their use merely provides a label with which to convince sceptical positivists of the rigour of inductive research techniques.Suite au débat méthodologique intervenu au sein de la communauté de la recherche dans les années 1990 dans le domaine de la gestion de construction, les études de recherche adoptant des méthodologies inductives se sont accrues. De nombreux projets de ce type ont adopté une analyse qualitative des données assistée par ordinateur à la fois afin de faciliter le processus de recherche et d'assurer une transparence et une rigueur méthodologiques. Néanmoins, une indigence du discours critique demeure, s'agissant de la littérature relative aux recherches dans le domaine de la gestion de construction concernant l'impact de telles approches sur la rigueur et le caractère approfondi des analyses qui en résultent. Cet article postule que les approches dites assistées par ordinateur ont la capacité d'affecter de façon préjudiciable les résultats des recherches dans le domaine de la gestion de construction si les chercheurs considèrent ces outils comme une panacée pour assurer la rigueur et la transparence de leurs travaux. Paradoxalement, les approches assistées par ordinateur restreignent souvent le processus analytique plus qu'elles n'y contribuent. L'article fait appel à l'expérience des auteurs concernant l'utilisation de l'un des principaux progiciels, à partir de laquelle un certain nombre de considérations relatives à l'utilisation des ordinateurs dans l'analyse qualitative des données sont discutées. La conclusion est que la communauté de la recherche tirerait avantage d'un débat ouvert sur le fait de savoir si les progiciels informatiques fournissent vraiment une panacée pour l'analyse des données qualitatives des projets de recherche appliquée dans le domaine de la gestion de construction, ou si leur utilisation ne fournit qu'une étiquette avec laquelle les positivistes sceptiques peuvent être convaincus de la rigueur des techniques de recherche inductives.},

	abstract = {Traditional crowd theory decontextualizes crowd incidents and explains behaviour entirely in terms of processes internal to the crowd itself. This ignores the fact that such incidents are characteristically intergroup encounters and draws attention away from the role of groups such as the police in the development of events. This paper begins to rectify this omission through an analysis of interviews with 26 Public Order trained police concerning crowds in general and the Poll Tax ‘riot’ of 31 March 1990 in particular. The analysis shows that, despite a perception of crowd composition as heterogeneous, officers perceive crowd dynamics as involving an anti-social minority seeking to exploit the mindlessness of ordinary people in the mass. Consequently, all crowds are seen as potentially dangerous and, in situations of actual conflict, all crowd members are seen as equally dangerous. In addition, police tactics for dealing with disorder make it very difficult to distinguish between individuals or subgroups in the crowd. This convergence of ideological and practical factors leads to the police treating crowds in disorder as an homogeneous whole. It is argued that such action can often play an important role in escalating (if not initiating) collective conflict and is also a key component of social change in crowd contexts. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This model begins to tackle the thorny theoretical problems posed by the dynamic nature of crowd action (Reicher, 1996b). The present paper describes an ethnographic study of a crowd event in which there were changes in the inter-group relationships over time. It is suggested that the laboratory evidence in support of SCT is complemented by ethnographic research of this type. By exploring situations in which definitions of context and/or categories are not purposefully manipulated, we can demonstrate the explanatory power of a dynamic and interactive approach to social categorization.},

De este modo, transcribir es una tarea política tan digna de atención como cualquier otra. Mi propuesta consiste en: i) reducir la cantidad de símbolos originales, ii) simplificar su acceso en teclados en castellano, iii) anular aquéllos, como puntos y comas, que puedan dificultar la comprensión de un/a lector/a no iniciado/a y, finalmente, iv) anular símbolos a priori poco útiles en investigaciones no discursivas.},

EL artículo comienza con la observación de que en la literatura sobre AC tales prácticas y los objetos analíticos que crean (la grabación y la transcripción) son tratados de manera diferente. Dicho de manera simple, la grabacíon es un objeto "realista", mientras que la transcripción es "constructivista". La importancia de esta diferencia es explorada a través del análisis de la dinámica de la práctica del AC. Argumentamos que la "transcripción constructivista", se basa en la premisa de una comprensión del AC como estrategia predominantemente interesada en maximizar su utilidad analítica: un interés por una etapa temporal distinta del trabajo del AC, la de la aprehensión "inocente" de objetos a través de su "primer momento". En contraste, la "transcripción realista" se basa en un aspecto diferente del trabajo del AC: la petición de una mayor "utilidad de evidencia", alcanzada por la revisión "nostálgica" de objetos previamente producidos con propósito de contrastarlos entre sí; trabajo realizado "a través del siguiente momento". Adicionalmente argumentamos que tanto la ontología y la epistemología de los objetos del AC se cambian en cualquier encuentro que ocurra. Concluimos con una advertencia especulativa sobre la actualmente proyectada transcripción libre y en el futuro digitalizada del AC.},

Rumor, mass hysteria, fads and fashion, UFOs, sports, migrations, disasters, riots, protest, and social movements are among the topics presented in a unique side-by-side presentation of the two disciplines. In an engaging, accessible style, Miller offers detailed discussion of classic sociological studies interspersed with intriguing modern-day examples that students will enjoy reading.

The functions of memos in the research process are discussed and a number of techniques for employing memo writing to enhance the research experience and outcomes are examined. Memoing is often discussed in the literature as a technique employed in grounded theory research, yet there is limited exploration of the value of memo writing in qualitative methodologies generally. Memoing serves to assist the researcher in making conceptual leaps from raw data to those abstractions that explain research phenomena in the context in which it is examined. Memos can be effectively employed by both the novice and experienced researcher as a procedural and analytical strategy throughout the research process. Data exploration is enhanced, continuity of conception and contemplation is enabled and communication is facilitated through the use of memoing. While guidelines exist to aid in the production and use of memos, memoing remains a flexible strategy wherein the process of construction and nature of content is determined by the preferences and abilities of the researcher and the aims and focus of the specific research study.},

	abstract = {Morality has long been considered an inherent quality, an internal moral compass that is unswayed by the actions of those around us. The Solomon Asch paradigm was employed to gauge whether moral decision making is subject to conformity under social pressure as other types of decision making have been shown to be. Participants made decisions about moral dilemmas either alone or in a group of confederates posing as peers. On a majority of trials confederates rendered decisions that were contrary to judgments typically elicited by the dilemmas. The results showed a pronounced effect of conformity: Compared to the control condition, permissible actions were deemed less permissible when confederates found them objectionable, and impermissible actions were judged more permissible if confederates judged them so.},

Then the central procedures of qualitative content analysis, inductive development of categories and deductive application of categories, are worked out. The possibilities of computer programs in supporting those qualitative steps of analysis are shown and the possibilities and limits of the approach are discussed.},

Seventy adults participated in a replication of Milgram’s Experiment 5 up to the point at which they first heard the learner’s verbal protest (150 volts). Because 79\% of Milgram’s participants who went past this point continued to the end of the shock generator’s range, reasonable estimates could be made about what the present participants would have done if allowed to continue. Obedience rates in the 2006 replication were only slightly lower than those Milgram found 45 years earlier. Contrary to expectation, participants who saw a confederate refuse the experimenter’s instructions obeyed as often as those who saw no model.
Men and women did not differ in their rates of obedience, but there was some evidence that individual differences in empathic concern and desire for control affected participants’ responses.},

In recent years new paradigms have been developed to circumvent these challenges but none involve using Milgram’s own procedures and asking naïve participants to deliver the maximum level of shock. This was achieved in the present research by using Immersive Digital Realism (IDR) to revisit the OtA paradigm. IDR is a dramatic method that involves a director collaborating with professional actors to develop characters, the strategic withholding of contextual information, and immersion in a real-world environment. 14 actors took part in an IDR study in which they were assigned to conditions that restaged Milgrams’s New Baseline (‘Coronary’) condition and four other variants. Post-experimental interviews also assessed participants’ identification with Experimenter and Learner. Participants’ behaviour closely resembled that observed in Milgram’s original research. In particular, this was evidenced by (a) all being willing to administer shocks greater than 150 volts, (b) near-universal refusal to continue after being told by the Experimenter that “you have no other choice, you must continue” (Milgram’s fourth prod and the one most resembling an order), and (c) a strong correlation between the maximum level of shock that participants administered and the mean maximum shock delivered in the corresponding variant in Milgram’s own research. Consistent with an engaged follower account, relative identification with the Experimenter (vs. the Learner) was also a good predictor of the maximum shock that participants administered.},

	shorttitle = {Social {Dilemmas}},
	abstract = {One of the key scientific challenges is the puzzle of human cooperation. Why do people cooperate? Why do people help strangers, even sometimes at a major cost to themselves? Why do people want to punish people who violate norms and undermine collective interests? This book is inspired by the fact that social dilemmas, defined in terms of conflicts between (often short-term) self-interest and (often longer-term) collective interest, are omnipresent. The book centers on two major themes. The first theme centers on the theoretical understanding of human cooperation: are people indeed other-regarding? The second theme is more practical, and perhaps normative: how can cooperation be promoted? This question is at the heart of the functioning of relationships, organizations, as well as the society as a whole. In capturing the breadth and relevance of social dilemmas and psychology of human cooperation, this book is structured in three parts. The first part focuses on the definition of social dilemmas, along with the historical development of scientific theorizing of human cooperation and the development of social dilemma as a game in which to study cooperation. The second part presents three chapters, each of which adopts a relatively unique perspective on human cooperation: an evolutionary perspective, a psychological perspective, and a cultural perspective. The third part focuses on applications of social dilemmas in domains as broad and important as management and organizations, environmental issues, politics, national security, and health. Social Dilemmas is strongly inspired by the notion that science is never finished. Each chapter therefore concludes with a discussion of two (or more) basic issues that are often inherently intriguing, and often need more research and theory. The concluding chapter outlines avenues for future directions.},

	abstract = {We are poised between an old world that no longer works and a new one struggling to be born. Surrounded by centralized hierarchies on the one hand and predatory markets on the other, people around the world are searching for alternatives. The Wealth of the Commons explains how millions of commoners have organized to defend their forests and fisheries, reinvent local food systems, organize productive online communities, reclaim public spaces, improve environmental stewardship and re-imagine the very meaning of "progress" and governance. In short, how they've built their commons.
	In 73 timely essays by a remarkable international roster of activists, academics and project leaders, this book chronicles ongoing struggles against the private com­moditization of shared resources - often known as market enclosures - while docu­menting the immense generative power of the commons. The Wealth of the Commons is about history, political change, public policy and cultural transformation on a global scale - but most of all, it's about individual commoners taking charge of their lives and their endangered resources.

"This fine collection makes clear that the idea of the Commons is fully international, and increasingly fully worked-out.

	abstract = {The growth in qualitative research is a well-noted and welcomed fact within the social sciences; however, there is a regrettable lack of tools available for the analysis of qualitative material. There is a need for greater disclosure in qualitative analysis, and for more sophisticated tools to facilitate such analyses. In this article details a technique for conducting thematic analysis of qualitative material, presenting a step-by-step guide of the analytic process, with the aid of an empirical example. The analytic method presented employs established, well-known techniques; the article proposes that thematic analyses can be usefully aided by and presented as thematic networks. Thematic networks are web-like illustrations that summarize the main themes constituting a piece of text. The thematic networks technique is a robust and highly sensitive toot for the systematization and presentation of qualitative analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Introduction. – Today’s fascination with television makes us wonder whether it might not represent an
 authority capable of leading people in a television studio to inflict cruel acts on others, even though they
 condemn those acts.
Objective. – The experiment reported here allows us to answer this question in the affirmative. Therefore,
 we transposed Milgram’s famous experimental obedience paradigm to the context of a “real” TV game
 show, in the studio of a large television production company, with a live audience and no prizes.
Method. – We set up several experimental conditions designed to tell us if, in such contexts, obedience
 was the dominant response, as it is in the often-replicated classic situation. We also wished to know if
 the introduction of variations would reduce obedience.
Results. – The results show that obedience to the host is the dominant response, as it is in Milgram’s classic
 situation. However, variations that are assumed to reduce this obedience do not in fact demonstrate the
 expected effects. An additional experimental condition appears to demonstrate that a determining factor
 of obedience is the physical proximity of the host incarnating the televisual power.
Conclusion. – We offer a conclusion addressing the societal aspects of obedience.},

	abstract = {Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},
