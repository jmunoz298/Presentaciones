El libro pretende ofrecer una visión global del comportamiento colectivo y de los movimientos sociales, tarea que había sido emprendida anteriormente en el marco de la sociología pero había quedado ampliamente desatendida por la psicología social académica, especialmente en lengua española. El trabajo guarda correspondencia con las tres partes en que se halla estructurado el libro, centrando su análisis en la primera parte (fundamentación científica del campo estudiado) y en la tercera, referente a los movimientos sociales. De la segunda parte, sólo se mencionan aquí algunas aportaciones psicosociales provenientes de la investigación grupal que pueden ser consideradas la más importante contribución de la psicología social experimental al estudio del comportamiento colectivo y de los movimientos sociales. Se enfatiza también la relevancia social del campo estudiado, tratándose de ofrecer el reflejo de una sociedad en proceso de globalización en algunos de sus aspectos más problemáticos, como la crisis ecológica, el sexismo, el terrorismo y las desigualdades sociales. The present exposition tries to condense the aspects dealt with in the textbook Collective Behavior and Social Movements. A Social-Psychological Approach (Javaloy, Rodriguez and Espelt, 2001) that can be more suggestive for the social psychologist. The book attempts to offer a global vision of collective behavior and social movements, task that had been undertaken previously within the framework of sociology but widely neglected by academic social psychology, specially in the Spanish language. The work keeps correspondence with the three parts in which the book is structured, our analysis focusing on the first part (scientific foundation of the field) and on the third one, referring to the social movements. Of the second part, only some social-psychological research on groups is mentioned that can be considered the most important contribution of experimental social psychology to the study of collective behavior and social movements. The social relevance of the field is also emphasized, trying to offer a reflection of the globalizing society in some of its more problematic aspects, such as ecological crisis, sexism, terrorism and social inequalities.},

This volume is a major contribution to the field of collective behavior, with implications for social movement analysis. McPhail’s critical assessment of the major theories of crowd behavior establishes that, whatever their particular limitations and strengths, all share a general and serious flaw: their explanations were developed without prior examination of the behaviors to be explained. Drawing on a wide range of empirical studies that include his own careful field work, the author offers a new characterization of temporary gatherings. He presents a life cycle of gatherings and a taxonomy of forms of collective behavior within gatherings, as well as combinations of these forms and gatherings into larger events, campaigns and waves. McPhail also develops a new explanation for various ways in which purposive actors construct collective actions.},

The present paper describes an ethnographic study of a crowd event in which there were changes in the inter-group relationships over time. It is suggested that the laboratory evidence in support of SCT is complemented by ethnographic research of this type. By exploring situations in which definitions of context and/or categories are not purposefully manipulated, we can demonstrate the explanatory power of a dynamic and interactive approach to social categorization.},

A participant observation study found evidence of a radicalized self concept among a number of crowd members, and indicates a link between radicalization, an asymmetry of categorical representations between protesters and the police, and the subsequent interaction premised on these divergent representations. The analysis supports an elaborated social identity model of crowd behaviour (Reicher, 1996, 1997a, 1997b; Stott \& Reicher, 1998). It is argued that, in order to account for both social determination and social change in collective behaviour, it is necessary to analyse crowd events as developing interactions between groups. Where crowd members hold a different understanding of their social position to that held by an out-group (e.g. the police) and where the out-group has the power to treat crowd members in terms of its understandings, then those members who act on the basis of one understanding of their social relations find themselves in an unexpected and novel set of social relations. This then provides the basis for a series of changes, including the self-understanding of crowd members.},

	abstract = {Traditional crowd theory decontextualizes crowd incidents and explains behaviour entirely in terms of processes internal to the crowd itself. This ignores the fact that such incidents are characteristically intergroup encounters and draws attention away from the role of groups such as the police in the development of events. This paper begins to rectify this omission through an analysis of interviews with 26 Public Order trained police concerning crowds in general and the Poll Tax ‘riot’ of 31 March 1990 in particular. The analysis shows that, despite a perception of crowd composition as heterogeneous, officers perceive crowd dynamics as involving an anti-social minority seeking to exploit the mindlessness of ordinary people in the mass. Consequently, all crowds are seen as potentially dangerous and, in situations of actual conflict, all crowd members are seen as equally dangerous. In addition, police tactics for dealing with disorder make it very difficult to distinguish between individuals or subgroups in the crowd. This convergence of ideological and practical factors leads to the police treating crowds in disorder as an homogeneous whole. It is argued that such action can often play an important role in escalating (if not initiating) collective conflict and is also a key component of social change in crowd contexts. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The analysis derives from a detailed account of a violent confrontation between students and police during a demonstration held in November 1988—the so-called ‘Battle of Westminster’. It focuses on how students came to be involved in the conflict, how the conflict spread and upon the psychological consequences of involvement. This analysis is used to develop general hypotheses concerning the initiation and development of collective conflict. It is concluded that, while the social identity model is of use in understanding these phenomena, it is necessary to recognize how social categories are constructed and reconstructed in the dynamics of intergroup interaction.},

	abstract = {The paper contains a detailed study of the St. Pauls' riots of April 1980. Particular attention is paid to the limits of participation in the event and the limits of crowd action. It is argued that these limits show clear social form and cannot be explained in terms of the individualistic theories that dominate crowd psychology. Instead a model of crowd behaviour based on the social identity model is advanced to account for the observations. It is concluded that crowd behaviour is more sophisticated and creative than hitherto allowed and that the neglect of this field should be remedied.},

Representa un importante paso hacia adelante en el programa de investigación sobre categorización e identidad social llevado a cabo por J. TURNER con H. TAJFEL. El libro plantea un desafío a la teoría dominante del grupo social en psicología, es decir, a la teoría de la «interdependencia social». Sostiene que los individuos se convierten en grupo, no en la medida en que desarrollan relaciones personales basadas en la satisfacción recíproca de necesidades, sino al desarrollar una categorización social compartida de sí mismos en contraposición a otros, una percepción compartida del «nosotros» en contraposición al «ellos».},

Up-to-date and meticulously researched, this popular volume continues to provide a systematic overview of theory and research. Each topic is meaningfully linked to the appropriate theories of collective behavior (mass hysteria, emergent-norm, and value-added perspectives) and collective action (social-behavioral interactionist, resource mobilization, and value-added perspectives). Rumor, mass hysteria, fads and fashion, UFOs, sports, migrations, disasters, riots, protest, and social movements are among the topics presented in a unique side-by-side presentation of the two disciplines. In an engaging, accessible style, Miller offers detailed discussion of classic sociological studies interspersed with intriguing modern-day examples that students will enjoy reading. His thorough topical treatment effectively reduces the need for outside readings.},

	abstract = {When British Paratroopers shot dead 13 people at a civil rights march in Derry on January 30, 1972 it dealt a hammer blow to British government claims of neutrality and moral authority in dealing with the escalating violence in Northern Ireland. Existing historical accounts of Bloody Sunday treat the killings as the outcome of a more-or-less unified military anxiety at increasing disorder in Derry, combined with unexpected events on the day, presenting the killings as the outcome of essentially responsive actions by the British military. In so doing they lend support to the ‘cock-up’ theory that represents the killings as the outcome of a series of errors of interpretation and communication. This article provides an alternative interpretation of the political and military decision-making process, challenging key elements in the analysis in the existing literature. By contrast with existing accounts, it argues that the Bloody Sunday operation was a calculated plan devised at a very high level to stage a massive and unprecedented confrontation that would disrupt and shatter an established policy of security force restraint in the city of Derry. It argues further that the operation that day emerged from an intense internal struggle to shape security policy that reflected deep divisions within the security forces, analysing the statements and evidence of key participants much more critically than existing accounts do. It argues that high-level decision-making is central to the explanation of the outcome that day and that the operation raises serious questions about the relationship between political decision-making and the operational decision-making of the army in Northern Ireland.},

	abstract = {While mass panic (and/or violence) and self-preservation are often assumed to be the natural response to physical danger and perceived entrapment, the literature indicates that expressions of mutual aid are common and often predominate, and collective flight may be so delayed that survival is threatened. In fact, the typical response to a variety of threats and disasters is not to flee but to seek the proximity of familiar persons and places; moreover, separation from attachment figures is a greater stressor than physical danger. Such observations can be explained by an alternative “social attachment” model that recognizes the fundamentally gregarious nature of human beings and the primacy of attachments. In the relatively rare instances where flight occurs, the latter can be understood as one aspect of a more general affiliative response that involves escaping from certain situations and moving toward other situations that are perceived as familiar but which may not necessarily be objectively safe. The occurrence of flight-and-affiliation depends mainly on the social context and especially the whereabouts of familiar persons (i.e., attachment figures); their physical presence has a calming effect and reduces the probability of flight-and-affiliation, while their absence has the opposite effect. Combining the factors of perceived physical danger and the location of attachment figures results in a four-fold typology that encompasses a wide spectrum of collective responses to threat and disaster. Implications of the model for predicting community responses to terrorist attacks and/or use of weapons of mass destruction are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Crowd behaviour in emergencies has previously been explained in terms of either ‘mass panic’ or strength of pre-existing social bonds. The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces ‘panic’ behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).},
